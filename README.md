This is my config and hud - including graphics settings, class configs, and some mods.   

m0re's hud from https://huds.tf/site/s-m0re-Hud.  
modified to have last damage done above ammo.   
config for each class works and is setup for my personal preference.  
mouse settings are the same across all classes.   

**NOTE**  
The `stickies_noalpha` folder is a mod that makes stickies super bright - __HOWEVER__ it is blocked by sv_pure 1/2 and will not work on comp servers.
